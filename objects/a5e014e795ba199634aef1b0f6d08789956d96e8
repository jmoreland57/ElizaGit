listen kid this is the ghost of henry george
remember me from your history class? you probably don't
american society is crumbling right now before your very eyes
protectionism has never been more prevalent
even joe biden (god bless his soul) has fallen prey to this viscious disease, this corruption of the mind
look at this way kid
has any civilization ever gotten anywhere by closing itself off to society?
no, of course not. cities and art and science and culture and progress have all manifested themselves in places where trade occurs
to institute protective tarriffs under the auspices of "safeguarding our industry" is to cut ourselves off from the world
it's to reduce our society to a backwater, to leave us stranded in the dust while the rest of the planet moves along and advances
it's to put sanctions on our own damn country
let me pull out a classic quote from my bestselling book progress and poverty

If to prevent trade were to stimulate industry and promote prosperity, then the localities where he was most isolated would show the first advances of man. The natural protection to home industry afforded by rugged mountains-chains, by burning deserts, or by seas too wide and tempestuous for the frail bark of the early mariner would have given us the first glimmerings of civilization and shown its most rapid growth. But, in fact, it is where trade could best be carried on that we find wealth first accumulating and civilization beginning. It is on accessible harbors, by navigable rivers and much traveled highways that we find cities arising and the arts and sciences developing.

let that one sit on your mind
